#  Installation



- **Python must be installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)**


## Usage 

- **Use format "email:password" line by line in the accounts.txt file.**

- **run the "run.bat" file.**

- **Enter the Spotify song/playlist link when asked to**


# Usage recommendations 

- **This system opens multiple background sites, so make sure you have plenty of RAM or use this on an unused computer. (It could be on a powerful virtual server.)**

- **I do not recommend changing the time sleep settings, I tried to make it like a real person.**
